## Problem Statement
It's a difficult problem to find the shortest path between two points.
Do you think you have what it takes to do as well as Google at guessing the
shortest path between two real locations? Try our game and find out if you
have a knack for solving the travelling salesman problem by inspection. 

## Our Solution
To implement this game, we will make use of the Google maps API, the Google
directions API, a backend technology (Django), geolocation, and various other
APIs and libraries.

The solution will focus on creating an easy-to-use, intuitive interface that
runs well on both mobile and desktop devices. The interface will depend on
Google APIs extensively to allow the user to create a path, adjust it, and
ultimately compare it to Google's solution (for scoring).

Overall, it shouldn't be too difficult to implement, and we'll be able to
spend time on making the game more fun, accessible, and interesting.

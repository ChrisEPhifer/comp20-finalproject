# Status Report 2: Friday, December 3

## New Tasks Accomplished
* Client Side:
  * Generating random nodes, as the start and destination for the path drawing
  * connection to additional google libraries
  
## Hurdles Overcome
* getting LatLng into random result selecter

## Next Steps
* Allow the user to drag or draw a path between the two points
* Use Directions API to find the optimal path for comparison purposes
* Data visualization (server side)
  * Generate a graph or chart to visualize the data in aggregate (this is probably easier on the server)
* Data visualization (client side)
  * Make a simple leaderboard that shows the top scores (either on a separate page or in a "pop-up")
